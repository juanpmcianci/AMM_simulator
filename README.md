# AMM simulator
## This is a repo for the AMM simulator, It's still in its early stages but the main files are:

`gbm.py`: file that simulates a geometric Brownian motion. This is used to model the oracle price.

`amm.py`: here all the classes for different AMM behaviours are contained. This includes, e.g., a UNIV2 trading function

`trading_logics.py`: defines a set of rules for the market mentality


If you want to run this and understand the structure of the code, for now, feel free to run:

`test_simulator.py`: a sanity check script to verify that everything makes sense
